FileType <- From which file (train or test) do these measurements come from
Activity <- From which activity (WALKING, etc) do these measurements come from
All the other columns provide the data of the mean or the std of different measurements (e.g. BodyAcceleration, etc)
The FFT stands for Fast Fourier Transform
